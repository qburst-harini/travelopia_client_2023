      "What are the departure dates for the vacation packages on your website?",
    desc: `There are no set departure dates for our trips because every tour is private, which means that you can depart on whatever day you wish.
          Every single itinerary on our website can start from any day of the year.`,
  },
  {
    topic: "Are these group tours?",
    desc: `We do not offer group tours. When we say our trips are private, that is exactly what we mean: the only travelers on your trip are you and the companions with whom you choose to travel.
     Your itinerary is completely flexible. You can pick and choose from a list of activities or sights each day. We can modify each day to suit your interests, your energy level and even the season! The only exception to this is when you are on a safari where you might share your vehicle with other guests of the lodge.
      Nevertheless, even in this case, we prefer to work with small lodges and camps with a personal service so we can accommodate your specific interests.`,

    topic:
      "Is international airfare included in the cost of your website vacation packages?",
    desc: `International airfare is not included, because we have found that our guests often prefer to arrange their own flights using frequent-flyer miles or other means.
     However, if you would like us to arrange your international flights or make suggestions on the best routes and timings then we are happy to do so.
     Please note that all regional and local flights and any other transportation during your trip is always included in the cost.`,

  {
    topic: "Will I have the same guide throughout my trip?",
    desc: `This depends on your itinerary. Most of the time we use knowledgeable local guides who are residents of the area they are showing you. They are experts and can be trusted to give you the best experience possible. `,
  },
  {
    topic: "Do you arrange my visas?",
    desc: `We are happy to support you in arranging the necessary visas for your travel, but it is usually necessary for guests to arrange them on their own. 
    Please talk to your Travel Consultant about visa requirements and any related questions you may have.`,

    topic:
      "Can an itinerary be designed that balances luxury and ‘off-the-beaten-track’ experiences?",
    desc: `Off-the-beaten-track means different things to different people, and there are a variety of ways to experience local culture. 
    Whether you simply want to spend a day driving through the countryside or if you’re looking for something more rigorous – such as 
    a remote trek or a homestay experience with a local family – we will do our best to accommodate your interests and desired level of comfort.`,

  {
    topic: "What is included in the cost of your vacation packages?",
    desc: `Our trips usually include all services from the moment your plane arrives at your destination, where a representative will be awaiting your arrival.
     All accommodation, transfers, regional and local flights, as well as activities, are arranged and included.
     Unless otherwise specified, our destinations are on a breakfast-only basis.`,
